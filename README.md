# diontryban.com

The source code for my personal website located at https://diontryban.com.

It uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [React](https://react.dev/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Content Collections](https://www.content-collections.dev/) for importing MarkDown.

## Development
I recommend using [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/) as your package manager instead of `npm` or `yarn` because it is faster and more efficient.

First, install the project's dependencies.
```bash
pnpm i
```

Then, run the development server.
```bash
pnpm run dev
```

The development server will be available at https://localhost:3000.
