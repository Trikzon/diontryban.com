My name is **Dion Tryban**. I am primarily a *game developer*, but I also create apps and websites. I am currently studying at [Florida State University](https://cs.fsu.edu).
<!-- While you're here, check out my [projects](/projects) and read my [blog](/blog). -->

I am the *President* of [DevLUp at FSU](https://fsu.devlup.org/), the video game development club at Florida State. As a club we host game jams, develop a club project, and do weekly workshops.

<!-- TODO: Have a link and image to my latest workshop at DevLUp. -->

My main project right now is [Mellohi](https://github.com/trikzon/mellohi), a *C++ WebGPU voxel game engine*. My goal is to use this project to learn how the many technologies behind modern games works. These underlying algorithms and systems are what interest me the most. I will be posting about this frequently, so check back soon.

<!-- TODO: Write a blog post about making minecraft mods and learning how to code. -->
<!-- In my free time, I maintain a few [Minecraft mods](/projects/mc-mods). They have gained over *65-million downloads* as of July, 2024. Modding is how I was first introduced to game development and Computer Science as a whole. -->
